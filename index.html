            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup 
            language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
            It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets 
            (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or
            from local storage and render the documents into multimedia 
            web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
            originally included cues for its appearance.
