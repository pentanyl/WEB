            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, 
            is a programming language that is one of the core technologies 
            of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 
            98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
            often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers \
            have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
